Hi, I’m @cheesent and I like cheese

I’m interested in getting more involved in linux distros, It's difficult to not to use windows when institutions recquire you to use it or software that is only available on it.

I’m currently learning LaTeX and Markdown, just for creating content like documents and I find them practical and useful.
